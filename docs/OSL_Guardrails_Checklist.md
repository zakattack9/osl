# OSL Guardrails Checklist
_Research-grounded boundaries for AI assistance in learning_

## Daily Session Checklist

### ✅ Micro-Loop Integrity
- [ ] **Free Recall First**: Did I complete my free recall BEFORE any AI questions?
- [ ] **Self-Explanation**: Did I write my Feynman explanation myself?
- [ ] **AI Questions After**: Did the Tutor only ask questions AFTER my recall?
- [ ] **Material-Focused**: Were AI questions about the content, not my recall quality?
- [ ] **Immediate Feedback**: Did I get corrective feedback right after each answer?

### ✅ Flashcard Authorship (Generation Effect)
- [ ] **I Decided**: Did I choose what concepts become flashcards?
- [ ] **I Wrote**: Did I write the card content myself?
- [ ] **I Identified Gaps**: Did the cards come from MY identified misses?
- [ ] **AI Assisted Only**: Did AI only help with formatting/citations?
- [ ] **8-Card Limit**: Did I stay within the session limit?

### ✅ Note Creation (Self-Explanation)
- [ ] **My Words**: Did I write permanent notes in my own words?
- [ ] **My Connections**: Did I identify the links between notes?
- [ ] **My Examples**: Did I generate my own examples?
- [ ] **No AI Generation**: Did I avoid having AI write notes for me?

### ✅ Curiosity Questions (Learner-Driven)
- [ ] **My Questions**: Did I generate my 5 curiosity questions?
- [ ] **Tracked Through**: Did I note when questions were answered?
- [ ] **No AI Suggestions**: Did I avoid having AI generate questions for me?

## Weekly Checklist

### ✅ Calibration Quiz (Testing Effect)
- [ ] **AI-Generated OK**: Weekly quiz can be AI-generated (6-10 items)
- [ ] **Blueprint-Based**: Questions follow structure (3 recall, 3-4 app, 2-3 transfer)
- [ ] **Prediction First**: Did I predict my performance before taking?
- [ ] **Rubric Feedback**: Did I get detailed feedback on each answer?

### ✅ Synthesis Essay (Transfer)
- [ ] **I Wrote**: Did I write the entire synthesis myself?
- [ ] **2-3 Concepts**: Did I integrate multiple concepts?
- [ ] **My Insights**: Are these my own connections, not AI's?
- [ ] **Citations Included**: Did I cite my sources?

## Research Evidence Supporting These Guardrails

### Why Free Recall Before AI Questions?
- **Testing Effect**: Roediger & Karpicke (2006) - Effortful retrieval drives learning
- **Preservation**: AI questions AFTER recall preserves the testing effect
- **Enhancement**: Immediate feedback amplifies benefits (Hattie & Timperley, 2007)

### Why Learner-Authored Flashcards?
- **Generation Effect**: Slamecka & Graf (1978) - Self-created > provided
- **Metacognition**: Deciding what's important IS the learning
- **Personal Relevance**: Your gaps, your words, your memory

### Why AI Can Generate Weekly Quizzes?
- **Low-Stakes Testing**: Improves retention without high pressure
- **Calibration Purpose**: External assessment for accuracy check
- **Efficiency**: Reduces quiz creation burden while preserving learning

## Quick Decision Tree

**Should AI do this task?**

```
Is it generating learning content?
├─ YES → Is it AFTER learner's attempt?
│   ├─ YES → Is it for feedback/testing?
│   │   ├─ YES → ✅ AI CAN DO (e.g., quiz questions after recall)
│   │   └─ NO → ❌ LEARNER MUST DO
│   └─ NO → ❌ LEARNER MUST DO (e.g., initial questions, flashcards)
└─ NO → Is it administrative?
    ├─ YES → ✅ AI CAN DO (e.g., scheduling, tracking)
    └─ NO → CHECK CASE-BY-CASE
```

## Red Flags - Stop If You See These

🚫 **AI suggesting what you should learn**
🚫 **AI writing your flashcard content**
🚫 **AI generating your curiosity questions**
🚫 **AI writing your permanent notes**
🚫 **AI doing recall for you**
🚫 **AI writing your synthesis**
🚫 **AI making connections between ideas for you**

## Green Lights - These Are OK

✅ **AI asking questions AFTER your recall**
✅ **AI providing corrective feedback with citations**
✅ **AI generating weekly calibration quizzes**
✅ **AI helping format flashcards you wrote**
✅ **AI verifying citations**
✅ **AI tracking your progress**
✅ **AI enforcing governance gates**
✅ **AI scheduling reviews**

## Session Template Addition

Add this to your session log:

```markdown
## Guardrail Check
- [ ] Completed free recall before AI questions
- [ ] Authored all flashcards myself
- [ ] AI only assisted with formatting/citations
- [ ] Generated my own curiosity questions
- [ ] Wrote permanent notes in my words
```

## Remember

The generation effect, testing effect, and self-explanation are not just nice-to-haves - they ARE the learning mechanism. AI should amplify these effects, not bypass them.

**When in doubt**: If AI doing it would remove your cognitive effort, YOU should do it.
