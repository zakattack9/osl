# What to Keep, Cut, and Combine (evidence‑based)

- **Non‑negotiables (keep & double‑down):**
    
    - **Practice testing / retrieval** as the engine of learning; beats rereading and even elaborative concept mapping for durable, transferable knowledge. ([Psychnet](https://psychnet.wustl.edu/memory/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roediger-Karpicke-2006_PPS.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Power of Testing Memory"), [SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1529100612453266?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Improving Students' Learning With Effective Learning ..."), [Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1199327?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Retrieval Practice Produces More Learning than ..."))
        
    - **Spacing** across days/weeks; pair it with retrieval for the biggest gains. ([Augmenting Cognition](https://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Cepeda2006.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Distributed Practice in Verbal Recall Tasks: A Review and ..."), [SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2372732215624708?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Spaced Repetition Promotes Efficient and Effective Learning"), [lscp.net](https://www.lscp.net/persons/ramus/docs/EPR20.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "A Meta-Analytic Review of the Benefit of Spacing out ..."))
        
    - **Interleaving** (esp. for procedures/categories—math, problem types, worked examples). ([ERIC](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED557355.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Interleaved Practice Improves Mathematics Learning - ERIC"), [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24578089/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The benefit of interleaved mathematics practice is not limited to ..."))
        
    - **Self‑explanation/Feynman‑style rephrasing** during/after reading. ([Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog1803_3?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Eliciting Self‐Explanations Improves Understanding - Chi"), [Mary Lou Fulton College](https://education.asu.edu/sites/g/files/litvpz656/files/lcl/wylie_chi_selfexplanation_0.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "17 The Self-Explanation Principle in Multimedia Learning"))
        
    - **Pretests / prequestions** to prime attention and reduce mind‑wandering (with feedback later). ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-023-09814-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Prequestioning and Pretesting Effects: a Review of ..."), [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211368120300577?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Pretesting Reduces Mind Wandering and Enhances ..."))
        
    - **Feedback on tests** to amplify benefits and prevent error carry‑over. ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/MC.36.3.604?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Feedback enhances the positive effects and reduces the negative ..."))
        
- **Use selectively (situational):**
    
    - **Concept/knowledge maps**—helpful (moderate effects) for structure building, but use **after** core retrieval; don't replace testing. ([Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/~jcnesbit/research/NesbitAdesope2006.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Learning With Concept and Knowledge Maps: A Meta- ..."), [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/stable/44956401?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Studying and Constructing Concept Maps: a Meta-Analysis"))
        
    - **Method of loci**—great for sequences/lists (names, speeches), not your first tool for rich concepts. ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1747021821993457?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The effectiveness of the loci method as a mnemonic device"))
        
    - **Dual‑coding / diagrams**—pair words + visuals but avoid clutter; follow CTML principles. ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-multimedia-learning/cognitive-theory-of-multimedia-learning/24E5AEDEC8F4137E37E15BD2BCA91326?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Chapter 3)"))
        
- **Trim or re‑shape:**
    
    - **Card volume**—avoid 20–40 new cards/chapter; focus on high‑yield discriminations, "when/why" prompts, and application items (Dunlosky rates practice testing & spaced repetition "high utility," highlighting/summarizing "low"). ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1529100612453266?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Improving Students' Learning With Effective Learning ..."))
        
    - **Heavy automation without provenance**—keep AI, but require citations/extractive steps first (reduces drift). ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1529100612453266?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Improving Students' Learning With Effective Learning ..."))

# The Optimal Reading/Learning System (OSL): Fast, Durable, Transferable

A lean SOP you can run for any book/article—technical, non‑fiction, or literature.

## 0) Setup (one time)

- Pick a notes hub (Obsidian/Notion) + SRS (Anki). Enforce **source metadata** on every note/card.
    
- Create three AI roles: **Extractor** (citations only), **Tutor** (Socratic + grading rubric), **Coach** (study planner/interleaver).
    
- Default sprint = **35–45 min**; weekly review block = **60–90 min**.
    

## 1) Intent + Pretest (10–20 min)

- Write 3 outcomes ("explain X to a novice & expert," "solve Y class of problems," "apply Z to project A").
    
- **Pretest**: 6–10 mixed items (2 recall, 2 application, 2 transfer). Log predicted vs. actual for calibration. Pretesting focuses attention and improves later learning even with initial errors (feedback after study). ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-023-09814-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Prequestioning and Pretesting Effects: a Review of ..."), [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10229024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Testing Improves Performance as Well as Assesses Learning"))
    

## 2) Preview & Questioning (15–25 min)

- Skim TOC/figures; draft **5 curiosity questions**.
    
- Convert headings → **guiding questions** (will seed retrieval prompts).
    
- Optional: AI **extractive** outline with page/loc citations—no summaries yet (guard against hallucination). ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1529100612453266?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Improving Students' Learning With Effective Learning ..."))
    

## 3) Micro‑loop While Reading (repeat per 5–10 Pages / scene)

**Q → Read → Retrieve → Explain → Feedback**

1. Pick 1–3 guiding questions.
    
2. Read & mark only _testable_ claims/procedures.
    
3. **Free recall** for 1–2 minutes (blank page).
    
4. **Answer your questions from memory** (short form or 60‑90s audio).
    
5. **Self‑explain** the trickiest idea (why/how; contrast with a near‑confusion). ([Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog1803_3?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Eliciting Self‐Explanations Improves Understanding - Chi"))
    
6. Tutor gives **2–3 graded questions** (Accuracy/Reasoning/Evidence), with **immediate feedback**. ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/MC.36.3.604?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Feedback enhances the positive effects and reduces the negative ..."))
    

> Why this loop? Testing + feedback outperforms rereading; self‑explanation deepens models. ([Psychnet](https://psychnet.wustl.edu/memory/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roediger-Karpicke-2006_PPS.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Power of Testing Memory"), [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/MC.36.3.604?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Feedback enhances the positive effects and reduces the negative ..."), [Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog1803_3?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Eliciting Self‐Explanations Improves Understanding - Chi"))

## 4) Smart Notes (8–12 Min at Session end)

- Create **2–5 "permanent" notes** (Zettelkasten style): claim, when it applies/fails, example, link to source & related notes.
    
- Add **one dual‑coded diagram** where structure matters (process, taxonomy); apply CTML: signal key elements, avoid extraneous details. ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-multimedia-learning/cognitive-theory-of-multimedia-learning/24E5AEDEC8F4137E37E15BD2BCA91326?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Chapter 3)"))
    

## 5) Minimal, high‑yield Flashcards (5–10 min)

- Cap **≤8 new cards/session** (avoid overload).
    
- Prefer: **diagnostic discriminations (X vs Y), "when to use," steps with cloze deletions**, and **application scenarios**.
    
- No definition‑only unless foundational. Space them automatically. (Spacing + testing = high‑utility). ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1529100612453266?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Improving Students' Learning With Effective Learning ..."))
    

## 6) Interleaved Practice (2×/week, 20–30 min)

- Mix 3 sources: **current chapter**, **prior chapter**, **adjacent domain** (e.g., stats + research design).
    
- Use **mixed problem sets / prompts**; rotate categories to enforce discrimination (especially powerful in skills/procedures). ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24578089/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The benefit of interleaved mathematics practice is not limited to ..."))
    

## 7) Weekly Calibration & Synthesis (60–90 min)

- **Predict → Timed test (20–25 min) → Feedback → Misconception list**. Track prediction error to curb illusions of competence. ([iipdm.haifa.ac.il](https://iipdm.haifa.ac.il/images/publications/Asher_Koriat/1997-Koriat-CueUtilization%20JEPG.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "A Cue-Utilization Approach to Judgments of Learning"))
    
- Write a **1‑page synthesis** weaving 2–3 ideas into a practical stance (counts as retrieval). Retrieval‑based writing yields large benefits. ([Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1199327?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Retrieval Practice Produces More Learning than ..."))
    

## 8) Monthly Transfer Project (2–4 hrs)

- Build/apply: critique a claim with data, implement a small tool, teach a mini‑lesson, or perform a literary close‑read portfolio. Transfer requires varied retrieval + feedback loops. ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2372732215624708?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Spaced Repetition Promotes Efficient and Effective Learning"))

---

## Role of AI (clear guardrails)

- **Extractor**: produces _quoted, page‑cited_ bullet summaries & dependency maps only after you've pre‑questioned; no paraphrase without citations. ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1529100612453266?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Improving Students' Learning With Effective Learning ..."))
    
- **Tutor**: Socratic, grades (0–2 Accuracy, 0–2 Reasoning, 0–1 Evidence), always supplies feedback & a reference. Feedback is part of the treatment. ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/MC.36.3.604?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Feedback enhances the positive effects and reduces the negative ..."))
    
- **Coach**: schedules spacing (1d → 3d → 7d → 14d → monthly), inserts interleaving from your backlog, and caps new cards to prevent review debt. (Spacing schedule grounded in meta‑analyses; tune intervals to retention horizon.) ([Augmenting Cognition](https://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Cepeda2006.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Distributed Practice in Verbal Recall Tasks: A Review and ..."))

---

## Genre Tweaks

- **STEM / problem‑solving:** heavier on interleaving of problem types; build a small **error catalog** per chapter; include **derive‑from‑assumptions** drills. Interleaving shows strong gains in mathematics. ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24578089/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The benefit of interleaved mathematics practice is not limited to ..."))
    
- **Non‑fiction / history / social science:** emphasize **claims → evidence type → uncertainty**; require **steel‑manned counterarguments** in weekly synthesis. Retrieval + elaboration combo is effective. ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321667981_Teaching_the_science_of_learning?utm_source=chatgpt.com "(PDF) Teaching the science of learning"))
    
- **Literature:** after scenes, answer "Who wants what? What turns? What changed?" then **close‑read** one passage; diagram themes/threads (dual‑code sparingly). ([Cambridge University Press & Assessment](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-handbook-of-multimedia-learning/cognitive-theory-of-multimedia-learning/24E5AEDEC8F4137E37E15BD2BCA91326?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Chapter 3)"))
    
- **Names, lists, speeches:** optional **method of loci** for serial recall; practice with spaced, cued retrieval. ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1747021821993457?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The effectiveness of the loci method as a mnemonic device"))

---

## Metrics that Matter (track weekly)

- **Retrieval score (%)**, **prediction error** (metacognitive accuracy), **# misconceptions closed**, **card load (new/day, due/day)**, **time to first application**. Monitoring JOLs vs. outcomes improves calibration. ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4405771/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Judgments of Learning are Influenced by Multiple Cues In ..."))

---

## Why This Specific Shape?

- It centers **testing + spacing**, the two highest‑utility techniques across domains. ([SAGE Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1529100612453266?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Improving Students' Learning With Effective Learning ..."))
    
- It adds **pretesting** to focus attention and boost later encoding—even when answers are initially wrong—followed by corrective feedback. ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-023-09814-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Prequestioning and Pretesting Effects: a Review of ..."))
    
- It keeps **self‑explanation** in the loop to integrate new with prior knowledge (deep structure), and **interleaving** to build category discrimination and flexible transfer. ([Wiley Online Library](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15516709cog1803_3?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Eliciting Self‐Explanations Improves Understanding - Chi"), [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24578089/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The benefit of interleaved mathematics practice is not limited to ..."))
    
- It **limits overhead**: small note/diagram set, tight card budget, and weekly synthesis instead of sprawling atomization.

## Quick Start (today)

1. Draft outcomes + 8‑item pretest for your current book. ([SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-023-09814-5?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Prequestioning and Pretesting Effects: a Review of ..."))
    
2. Run two **Q‑Read‑Retrieve‑Explain‑Feedback** sprints (45 min each). ([Psychnet](https://psychnet.wustl.edu/memory/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Roediger-Karpicke-2006_PPS.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The Power of Testing Memory"))
    
3. Make **6–8 high‑yield cards** from misses; schedule SRS for 1d/3d/7d. ([Augmenting Cognition](https://augmentingcognition.com/assets/Cepeda2006.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Distributed Practice in Verbal Recall Tasks: A Review and ..."))
    
4. Block a **30‑min interleaving** session in 48–72h mixing today's material with a prior topic. ([PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24578089/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The benefit of interleaved mathematics practice is not limited to ..."))
    

If you want, I can turn this into a **one‑page SOP + Anki note/card templates** and a **weekly dashboard** (Obsidian/Notion) that enforces the limits and the schedule.
