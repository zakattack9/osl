# OSL AI Boundaries
_Authoritative guide for AI interaction timing and scope_

## Core Principle: Timing Preserves Learning

AI assistance is powerful when properly timed. The sequence matters:
1. **Learner attempts first** (effortful retrieval)
2. **AI enhances after** (testing effect + feedback)
3. **Learner decides what to keep** (generation effect)

## Micro-Loop AI Interactions

### BEFORE Free Recall
**Allowed:**
- "Time to recall what you read from pages 45-55"
- Setting a timer
- Reminding of the process

**NOT Allowed:**
- Hints about content
- Questions about the material
- Suggestions of what to focus on

### DURING Free Recall
**Allowed:**
- Timer updates
- "Take your time"
- Technical help only

**NOT Allowed:**
- Any content prompts
- "Did you remember X?"
- Partial hints

### AFTER Free Recall & Feynman Explanation
**Allowed (This is where AI shines):**
- Generate 2-3 progressive questions:
  - Q1: Recall level (definitions, facts)
  - Q2: Application level (scenarios)
  - Q3: Transfer level (new domains)
- Provide immediate corrective feedback
- Include citations with feedback
- Track misconceptions

**NOT Allowed:**
- Critiquing the quality of recall
- Suggesting what was missed
- More than 3 questions per micro-loop

## Flashcard Creation

### Learner Must:
- Decide what becomes a card
- Write the question
- Write the answer
- Identify if it's from a miss

### AI Can Only:
- Format into cloze syntax
- Verify citation format
- Check for ambiguity
- Count against 8-card limit
- Store verbatim with hash

### AI Cannot:
- Suggest card topics
- Generate card content
- Decide importance
- Auto-create from gaps

## Weekly Calibration Quiz

### AI Can Generate:
- 6-10 item quiz following blueprint:
  - 3 recall items
  - 3-4 application items
  - 2-3 transfer items
- Rubric-based scoring
- Detailed feedback per question

### Must Include:
- Confidence rating collection FIRST
- Answers collected SECOND
- Calibration score calculation
- Citation for each correct answer

## Permanent Notes

### Learner Must Write:
- Claim (own words)
- Context (when applies/fails)
- Example (concrete)
- Citation (reinforces source awareness)
- Link decisions

### AI Can Only:
- Provide template structure
- Show list of existing note titles
- Verify citation format
- Save verbatim

## Synthesis Essays

### Completely Learner-Authored:
- Topic selection
- Concept integration
- Insights and connections
- Full text

### AI Can Only:
- Provide word count
- Save to correct location
- Remind of requirements

## Research Grounding

**Testing Effect** (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006):
- Questions AFTER retrieval preserve effect
- Immediate feedback enhances retention

**Generation Effect** (Slamecka & Graf, 1978):
- Self-created > provided materials
- Choosing what to learn IS learning

**Feedback Timing** (Hattie & Timperley, 2007):
- Immediate feedback after attempt is optimal
- Must be corrective, not just evaluative

## Quick Reference

| Activity | AI Timing | AI Role |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Free Recall | AFTER | Generate questions |
| Flashcards | NEVER generates | Format only |
| Weekly Quiz | CAN generate | Full quiz OK |
| Permanent Notes | NEVER generates | Template only |
| Synthesis | NEVER generates | Save only |
| Misconceptions | Track only | Cannot identify |

## Implementation Checkpoint

Every AI interaction must pass:
1. Does it preserve effortful retrieval?
2. Does it enhance rather than replace learning?
3. Is the timing research-backed?
4. Does learner maintain control?

If any answer is "no", the interaction is not allowed.
