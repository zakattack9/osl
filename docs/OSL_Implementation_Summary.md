# OSL Implementation Summary
_All gaps and inconsistencies have been fixed_

> **Date**: August 29, 2025  
> **Status**: ✅ Implementation Ready  
> **Gap Analysis**: [Archived](archived/OSL_Gap_Analysis_Report.md)

## ✅ Fixes Completed

### 1. Curiosity Question Tracking (IMPLEMENTED)
**Previous Gap**: No mechanism to track the 5 curiosity questions
**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `osl questions/` command suite (add, list, resolve, pending)
- Session state tracks questions with resolution status
- Questions tracked throughout reading with page references
- Marked as [LEARNING] activity requiring cognition

**CLI Commands**:
```bash
osl questions add --question "How does X relate to Y?"
osl questions resolve --id 1 --answer "Found on p45" --page 45
osl questions pending  # Shows unresolved
```

### 2. Per-Micro-Loop Metrics (IMPLEMENTED)
**Previous Gap**: Metrics only collected at session end
**Solution Implemented**:
- Added `osl microloop/` command suite
- Real-time retrieval rate calculation after each micro-loop
- Immediate governance gate checking
- Verbatim preservation of recall and Feynman explanations

**CLI Commands**:
```bash
osl microloop complete \
  --pages "45-50" \
  --recall-quality "complete" \
  --confidence 4 \
  --recall-text "$(cat recall.txt)" \
  --explain-text "$(cat feynman.txt)"
```

### 3. State Schema Standardization (FIXED)
**Previous Inconsistency**: Two different schemas in different documents
**Solution**: Adopted Implementation Guide L3 as authoritative
- Single `coach_state.json` structure
- Added governance thresholds with tuning ranges
- Consistent across all documents

### 4. Misconception Workflow (CLARIFIED)
**Previous Gap**: Unclear who identifies and when
**Solution Implemented**:
- Learner identifies during micro-loops
- Explicit CLI command for tracking
- Linked to specific micro-loop number
- Marked as [LEARNING] activity

**CLI Command**:
```bash
osl misconception add \
  --concept "deep work vs flow" \
  --wrong "same thing" \
  --correct "practice vs experience"
```

### 5. Permanent Note Link Discovery (FIXED)
**Previous Issue**: AI finding and suggesting links
**Solution**:
- Learner searches for connections
- System shows list of note titles only
- Learner decides what links to create
- Preserves self-explanation principle

### 6. Citation Handling (FIXED)
**Previous Issue**: System auto-filling citations
**Solution**:
- Learner writes citations to reinforce source awareness
- System verifies format only
- No auto-completion

### 7. Verbatim Preservation (IMPLEMENTED)
**Previous Gap**: No mechanism to preserve exact learner input
**Solution**:
- `preserve_verbatim()` function with SHA256 hashing
- Applied to all learning activities:
  - Free recall text
  - Feynman explanations
  - Flashcard content
  - Quiz answers
- Hash stored for verification

### 8. Learning/Admin Boundaries (IMPLEMENTED)
**Previous Gap**: No clear distinction in commands
**Solution**:
- `CommandType` enum (LEARNING vs ADMIN)
- Every command marked explicitly
- Clear in CLI architecture diagram
- Prevents automation of cognitive tasks

### 9. Document Inconsistencies (ALL FIXED)

#### Micro-Loop Triggers
- **Was**: Only "5-10 pages" mentioned
- **Now**: Consistent across all docs:
  - Technical: 5-10 pages
  - Dense: 3-5 pages
  - Literature: 1 scene/chapter
  - Lists: Natural sections

#### Feynman Explanation Length
- **Was**: "short" vs "3-5 sentences"
- **Now**: Standardized to "3-5 sentences" everywhere

#### Tuning Ranges
- **Was**: Fixed values only
- **Now**: All governance parameters have ranges:
  - Calibration: 75-85% (default 80%)
  - Card Debt: 1.5x-2.5x (default 2x)
  - New Cards: 4-10 (default 8)
  - Interleaving: 1-3x/week (default 2x)

### 10. Flashcard Limit Enforcement (IMPLEMENTED)
**Previous Gap**: No enforcement mechanism
**Solution**:
- Check against session limit in `cmd_flashcard_create()`
- Reduces to 4 cards if calibration gate failing
- Clear error messages with remaining count

### Session State Structure (Enhanced)
```json
{
  "curiosity_questions": [...],     // NEW: Full lifecycle
  "micro_loops": [...],             // NEW: Per-loop tracking
  "misconceptions": [...],          // NEW: Clear workflow
  "flashcards_created": [...],      // Learner-authored only
  "retrieval_rate_realtime": 87,    // NEW: During session
  "verbatim_hashes": {...}          // NEW: Preservation
}
```

## Validation Against OSL Principles

✅ **Principle 1 (Retrieval)**: Preserved through verbatim capture
✅ **Principle 2 (Spacing)**: Governance thresholds with ranges
✅ **Principle 3 (Interleaving)**: Flexible 1-3x/week
✅ **Principle 4 (Self-explanation)**: Learner writes all content
✅ **Principle 5 (Feedback)**: AI after learner attempt only
✅ **Principle 6 (Calibration)**: Real-time metrics enable accuracy
✅ **Principle 7 (Transfer)**: Synthesis remains learner-driven
✅ **Principle 8 (Curiosity)**: Full question lifecycle tracking

## Ready for Implementation

All gaps identified in the Gap Analysis Report have been addressed:
1. Critical violations fixed per research verdicts
2. All inconsistencies resolved
3. Missing features implemented
4. Workflows clarified
5. Boundaries explicit

The system now:
- Preserves all learning mechanisms
- Tracks everything needed for OSL
- Maintains clear AI/learner boundaries
- Has consistent documentation
- Includes all necessary CLI commands
