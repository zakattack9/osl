## 📚 What is OSL?
OSL is a research-backed, AI-assisted learning system that optimizes comprehension, retention, and transfer through eight core principles:

1. **Retrieval Practice** - Active recall strengthens memory more than passive reading
2. **Spaced Repetition** - Review at increasing intervals (1d → 3d → 7d → 14d → 28d → monthly)
3. **Interleaving** - Mix topics to strengthen discrimination and transfer
4. **Self-Explanation** - Rephrase in your own words (Feynman technique)
5. **Immediate Feedback** - Correct errors quickly to prevent consolidation
6. **Calibration** - Test predictions against actual performance
7. **Transfer** - Apply knowledge through projects and synthesis
8. **Curiosity-Driven Questioning** - Use learner-generated questions as anchors

### Phase 2: State Management System

#### 2.1 Core State Architecture
```json
// coach_state.json - Central governance and metrics
{
  "version": "3.0",
  "active_books": [...],
  "governance_thresholds": {
    "calibration_gate": {"min": 75, "current": 80, "max": 85},
    "card_debt_multiplier": {"min": 1.5, "current": 2.0, "max": 2.5},
    "max_new_cards": {"min": 4, "current": 8, "max": 10},
    "interleaving_per_week": {"min": 1, "current": 2, "max": 3}
  },

}

// current_session.json - Active session tracking
{
  "session_id": "20250130_093000",
  "micro_loops": [...],
  "curiosity_questions": [...],
  "flashcards_created": 0,
  "state": "READING",
  "state_history": [...]
}
```

#### 2.2 State Machine Enforcement
Valid transitions with prerequisites:
```
SESSION_INIT
  → PREVIEW (requires: book selected)
  → READING (requires: curiosity questions)
  → RECALL_PENDING (requires: reading complete)
  → RECALL_ACTIVE (requires: book closed)
  → RECALL_COMPLETE (requires: verbatim text)
  → FEYNMAN_PENDING (requires: recall saved)
  → FEYNMAN_ACTIVE (requires: user ready)
  → FEYNMAN_COMPLETE (requires: explanation text)
  → AI_QUESTIONS (requires: recall + feynman done)
  → FLASHCARD_CREATION (requires: gaps identified)
  → SESSION_END (requires: state saved)
```

#### 2.3 Content Preservation
- **Verbatim storage** with SHA256 hashing
- **Atomic writes** with backup-before-modify
- **Version migration** for schema updates
- **Immutable logs** in session_logs/

### Phase 3: Governance Engine

#### 3.1 Adaptive Thresholds
| Gate         | Range     | Default  | Measurement         | Action When Failing |
| ------------ | --------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Calibration  | 75-85%    | 80%      | 7-day retrieval avg | Pause new content   |
| Card Debt    | 1.5×-2.5× | 2.0×     | Due ÷ throughput    | Block new cards     |
| New Cards    | 4-10      | 8        | Per session         | Enforce cap         |
| Interleaving | 1-3/week  | 2/week   | Sessions tracked    | Schedule mixing     |
| Transfer     | Monthly   | Required | Projects completed  | Block new books     |

#### 3.2 Gate Implementation
```python
class GovernanceGate:
    def check(self) -> GateStatus:
        # Returns: passing/failing/warning
        # Actions: block/warn/allow
        # Remediation: specific steps
```

#### 3.3 Tuning Logic
- **Auto-adjust** based on performance patterns
- **User override** within safe ranges
- **Coach guidance** via AI recommendations

### Phase 4: AI Integration Layer

#### 4.1 Critical Boundaries (Non-Negotiable)
```python
# TIMING RESTRICTIONS
class AIBoundaries:
    def can_interact(self, session_state):
        # AI can ONLY interact after:
        # 1. Free recall complete (verbatim stored)
        # 2. Feynman explanation complete (hashed)
        # NEVER during reading or recall phases

    def can_generate(self, content_type):
        # AI can generate:
        # - Quiz questions (weekly calibration only)
        # - Progressive questions (2-3 after recall)
        #
        # AI CANNOT generate:
        # - Flashcards (generation effect)
        # - Curiosity questions (learner-driven)
        # - Permanent notes (self-explanation)
        # - Synthesis essays (integration)
```

#### 4.2 AI Roles Implementation

**Extractor** (Cited outlines only)
```python
def extract_outline(text):
    # Returns: Bullet points with [p.X] citations
    # Never: Paraphrasing or summarizing
    # Always: Direct quotes when possible
```

**Tutor** (Questions after recall)
```python
def generate_questions(recall_text, source_text):
    # Timing: ONLY after free recall complete
    # Count: 2-3 questions maximum
    # Progression: Recall → Application → Transfer
    # Never: Hints during recall phase
```

**Coach** (Schedule and governance)
```python
def manage_schedule():
    # Tracks: Spacing intervals, due items
    # Enforces: Governance gates
    # Suggests: Threshold adjustments
    # Never: Overrides learner decisions
```

### Phase 5: Workflow Integration

#### 5.1 Session Workflow (45 minutes)
```
1. Setup & Intent (5 min)
   - Select book/topic
   - Define 3 learning outcomes

      - Use analogies and examples
      - Store verbatim
   e. AI Questions (1-2 min)
      - ONLY AFTER recall + explain complete
      - 2-3 progressive questions max
      - Recall → Application → Transfer
   f. Identify Gaps
      - Note what you missed
      - Mark for flashcard creation

4. Flashcard Creation (5 min)
   - LEARNER authors all cards
   - From identified gaps (≥60%)
   - Maximum 8 per session
   - Each card includes:
     * Front: Your question
     * Back: Your answer
     * Gap: What you missed
     * Source: Page reference

  2. Quiz (6-10 items: 3 recall, 3-4 application, 2-3 transfer)
  3. Scoring & feedback (immediate, corrective)
  4. Synthesis essay (300-400 words, 2-3 concepts integrated)
  5. Concept map (5 minutes MAX, visual connections)
Sunday: Review & Planning
```

#### 5.3 Monthly Workflow
```
Week 1-3: Regular learning
Week 4: Transfer Project
  - Applied artifact

```

### Phase 6: Claude Code Integration

#### 6.1 Slash Commands
```markdown
# .claude/commands/osl-start.md
---
allowed-tools: Bash(osl:*)
argument-hint: [book title]
description: Start OSL session
---

Parse natural language → Execute: osl session start
```

#### 6.2 Subagents
```markdown
# .claude/agents/osl-tutor.md
---
tools: Read, Write
description: Generate questions AFTER recall
---

Check session state → Verify recall complete → Generate 2-3 questions
```

#### 6.3 CLAUDE.md Memory
```markdown
# Project-level ./CLAUDE.md
- OSL principles and boundaries
- Current book context
- Active learning outcomes
- Import: @ai_state/coach_state.json
```

#### 6.4 Hooks
```json
{
  "UserPromptSubmit": "Load OSL context",
  "PostToolUse:Write": "Update metrics",
  "SessionEnd": "Save state, git commit"
}
```

### Phase 7: External Integrations

#### 7.1 Anki Integration
```python
# Primary: AnkiConnect API
def sync_cards():
    # Connect to local Anki
    # Create/update deck: "OSL::BookName"
    # Add cards with cloze format

# Fallback: APKG export
def export_cards():
    # Generate .apkg file
    # Include scheduling data
```

#### 7.2 Obsidian Integration
```python
def create_permanent_note():
    """
    Permanent Note Structure (LEARNER-AUTHORED):
    1. Claim: Core concept in one sentence
    2. Context: Where/when this applies
    3. Example: Concrete instance
    4. Citation: Source [Book, p.X]
    """
    return {
        "location": "obsidian/10_books/{book_slug}/",
        "filename": "YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_{concept}.md",
        "frontmatter": {
            "tags": ["book/{book_slug}", "concept/{topic}"],
            "created": "ISO-8601",
            "book": "{title}",
            "page": "X"
        },
        "content": "LEARNER-WRITTEN",
        "links": "[[other_notes]]"
    }
```

#### 7.3 Git Integration
```python
def auto_commit():
    # Trigger: Session end
    # Commit: State files, notes, cards
    # Message: "Session {id}: {book} p{start}-{end}"
```

### Phase 8: Natural Language Interface

#### 8.1 Three-Layer Model
```
Layer 1: Direct CLI
  osl session start --book "Deep Work"

Layer 2: Slash Commands
  /osl-session start Deep Work

Layer 3: Natural Language
  "Let's start reading Deep Work"
  → Show: "Interpreting as: osl session start --book 'Deep Work'"
  → Confirm: "Is this correct? [Y/n]"
```

#### 8.2 Interpretation Rules
- **Always show** command translation
- **Always confirm** state changes
- **Always preserve** original input
- **Always provide** manual fallback

### Phase 9: Advanced Features

    # - Maximum 3 items only
    # - 90 seconds total time
    # - Simple recall questions only
    # - NOT a full diagnostic quiz
    #
    # Purpose: Prime relevant knowledge
    # Never: Test comprehensive understanding

    return {
        "items": 3,
        "time_limit": 90,
        "type": "recall_only",
        "scoring": "formative_only"
    }
```

#### 9.2 Interleaving System
```python
def detect_interleaving():
    # Monitor: Topic switches in session
    # Threshold: 30-50% mixed content
    # Track: Weekly frequency

def schedule_interleaving():
    # Default: 2× per week
    # Duration: 20-30 minutes
    # Activities: Discrimination, transfer
```

#### 9.3 Misconception Tracking
```python
def track_misconception():
    # Capture: Failed recalls, wrong answers
    # Store: misconceptions.json with context
    # Schedule: Targeted remediation in next session
    # Resolve: Through 2+ successful retrievals
    # Track: Resolution rate over time

    return {
        "id": "misc_001",
        "content": "Confused deep work with flow state",
        "source": "p.48",

## 🚨 Critical Implementation Rules

### Six-Gate Framework (Evaluate ALL Changes)
Before implementing ANY new feature or modification, it must pass all six gates:

1. **Research Gate**: Is there peer-reviewed evidence supporting this?
2. **Mechanism Gate**: Do we understand WHY it works?
3. **Sustainability Gate**: Can learners maintain this for 3+ months?
4. **Interaction Gate**: How does it affect other OSL components?
5. **Complexity Gate**: Is the added complexity worth the learning gain?
6. **Agency Gate**: Does it preserve learner control and effort?

If any gate fails → Document the decision and rejection rationale in V3_Decision_History.md

### Never Violate These Principles
1. **Generation Effect** - Learner MUST author all flashcards
2. **Testing Effect** - AI questions only AFTER free recall
3. **User Agency** - Never override explicit user input
4. **Governance Gates** - Never bypass when triggered
5. **Verbatim Preservation** - Store exact learner input with hashes

### Common Implementation Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Allowing AI to generate flashcards "for convenience"
- ❌ Running pre-reading quiz beyond 3-item probe
- ❌ AI hints during free recall phase
- ❌ Interpreting natural language without confirmation
- ❌ Ignoring governance gates "just this once"
- ❌ Creating features without Six-Gate Framework evaluation
- ❌ Modifying learner content without explicit permission

## 🎓 Remember: OSL's Purpose

OSL exists to maximize learning through evidence-based practices. Every implementation decision should ask:

1. Does this enhance learning or just add convenience?
2. Does this preserve learner agency and effort?
3. Does this have research backing?
4. Is the complexity worth the learning gain?

**When in doubt, favor learning over convenience.**
